Translate functions into React components
Start with hardcoded cards
then figure out how to grab generated cards from firebase

Summary of Spanish matching game:
-variables needed: selectedId, dropTargetId, matching counter

-drag function: Spanish game has dragStart, dragEnter, dragLeave, dragOver and dragDrop
-dragStart selects current ID, dragEnter and dragLeave deal with a class ('over') by adding or removing it -- these are only called in the function addEventListeners (bottom of page) -- changes color when hovered
-dragOver invokes event.preventDefault
-dragDrop handles removing matches by setting display to none if a match is made, also adds 1 to counter

-checkForMatch function: both ways (dragging English or Spanish ex)
-JS app works by using switch case and booleans (checkForMatch and checkForMatch2 -- both used in dragDrop function)

-counter function (maybe? Spanish game counts to 5, which was the maximum number of matches provided)

-playAgain function: reset cards, shows End message

-useEffect for addEventListener functions

-create static list of questions and ansers with matching IDs then loop through the list to display on page.
